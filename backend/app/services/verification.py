"""
Post-extraction verification: every value the LLM returns is checked
against the actual document text, deterministically.

Structured Outputs guarantees the SHAPE of the extraction; this pass
guards its TRUTHFULNESS — the two failure modes that survive a strict
schema are a hallucinated value and a wrong page citation. For each
extracted value (which the prompt requires to be verbatim):

  1. Confirm the value appears on its cited page — first as normalized
     text, then by significant digit runs, so "GBP 12,600" still matches
     a document that printed "£12,600".
  2. If it is not on the cited page but appears on exactly ONE other
     page, the page link is corrected (and logged).
  3. If it appears nowhere in the document, the value is downgraded to
     'uncertain', its page link is cleared, and the field is reported in
     `review.unverified_fields` — the broker sees an amber flag instead
     of a plausible-looking wrong number (BRD: "a wrong number that
     looks plausible survives proofreading").
  4. A value with no page cite that appears on exactly one page gains
     that page link — recovering source links the sanitizer had to drop.

Summary-style fields (`additional_info`) are exempt: they paraphrase by
design, so verbatim matching would false-flag them.
