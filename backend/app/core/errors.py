"""
Pipeline exception hierarchy.

Every exception's *message* is written to be safe for API clients — no raw
upstream responses, stack traces, or internal paths. Anything sensitive is
logged where the error is raised, never put in the message. The API layer
maps `status_code` straight onto the HTTP response, so adding a new error
type never requires touching the routes.
